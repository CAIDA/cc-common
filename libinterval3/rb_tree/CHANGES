Mon Nov 17, 2014: [Vasco Asturiano, vasco@caida.org] Correct initialization of info 
				  field in nil and root nodes.

Fri Nov 07, 2014: [Vasco Asturiano, vasco@caida.org] Added a callback function
				  argument (RotationCallback(node)) to tree initialization which gets triggered
				  on tree rotations for each of the nodes affected by the rotation.
				  This is necessary for tree augmentation in which extended attributes
				  of the nodes need to be recomputed on tree rotations, e.g. max 
				  value on Interval Trees. This only makes sense for extended attributes
				  that are completely derived by the node itself and its children, not the parents.

Sun Jan 09, 2005: I fixed a bug that caused the test_rb program to
                  go into an infinite loop if the user entered an
                  invalid key.  Thanks to Amores Perros for pointing
                  out this problem.

Wed Sep 19, 2001: I fixed some bugs and memory leaks pointed out
                  by Brett Donahue and added some rudimentary
                  memory checking tests to the makefile.
